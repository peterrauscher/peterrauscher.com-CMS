There's a concept in the realm of distributed systems known as **eventual consistency. **It dictates that the result of writing a value to any one server will - at some point in the future - be reflected in all read operations from all other servers. In other words, the value provided by this system may not always be consistent across partitions, but it will eventually be so given enough time. While this is largely applicable to system design, it's a fitting allegory for how many of the most successful and productive people in human history live their lives.


An eventually consistent system generally makes a tradeoff of between speed and accuracy. A great example of this is the like counter on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Users generally won't mind that the like count on a post is off by a few hundred likes, so there's no reason to wait for all of the counted likes to synchronize across all of the databases. It's much better to load the post as fast as possible, show a potentially inaccurate number, and keep the user engaged and scrolling.


Consider your own life for a moment. You always hear about how important balance is in everything you do: work, diet, exercise, social engagement. Especially if you're someone who's keen on personal growth and self improvement, this is a probably a common thread you've seen shared across almost every philosophy, culture, and way of life. We're constantly told that we'll achieve our dreams only if we strive for balance in everything we do. I find this to be a fundamental flaw in most people's mindsets.


When you make balance your goal, you spend more time trying to achieve it than you spend  getting after what you want from your life. You begin to miss the forest for the trees. Perfect balance becomes this optimization problem you strive to perfect, and it consumes all of your time and energy in the process. I'm telling you, that time and energy is much better spent on _output._


You use it to justify not putting in the long hours when it could pay dividends, because someone told you work-life balance is important. You use it to justify eating a brownie when you're cutting weight because you've been good all day. It isn't always the case, but balance is often times an excuse to come just short of your goals but never quite all the way there.
