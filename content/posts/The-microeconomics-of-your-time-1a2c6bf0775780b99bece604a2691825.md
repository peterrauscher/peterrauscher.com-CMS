If you’re reading my blog for whatever reason, you’re likely a software developer or other well paid technical professional and this will likely apply to you.


When I was broke in college, and first starting out in my career, I wanted to save as much as possible. I applied my analytical mindset to every purchase I made - groceries, gas, clothes. It was _exhausting_ and **incredibly** time consuming. I was willing to sacrifice my time to save a few bucks.


I now know my output potential is much higher and I’d rather preserve my time to allocate towards that output than make these decisions. Money is a big pool of water, and as long as you can keep the faucet pouring faster than it’s draining you’re in the clear. It’s prudent to have a nice retention basin built up too.


If you’re like me and used to do a timely cost-benefit analysis on literally every purchase, I encourage you to try a month where you pay for every convenience (i.e. saves you time, not _luxury_ which makes you feel good) you reasonably can. Notice the difference in how much more free time you have, and put that towards furthering your career, building a brand, whatever.


Everything nowadays is competing for your time and attention. Social media, advertisements, TV, movies, podcasts, music, books, news - there is no shortage of things to consume. Step back and remember they are competing for your time because it is valuable.


I sound like a sigma-male, cigar-smoking, 5AM club grindset guy now, but that is not what I want you to take away. I just encourage every you - the person reading this who probably min/maxxed your way into the position you’re in today - to consider your time as more valuable than your hourly rate. It’s the most finite resource you have, spend it wisely.
