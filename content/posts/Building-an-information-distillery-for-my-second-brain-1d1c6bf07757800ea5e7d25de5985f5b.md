ADHD has always led me to operate a little differently than my neurotypical peers. Hyperactivity and an easily distracted mind means I bounce around from one thought train to the next at a frequency you can measure in CPU cycles. The engineers among you will know the overhead associated with context switching.


Whenever I’m reading documentation, blog posts, watching a video, or just seeing an ad on the train, I come across a wealth of useful information I'm excited to dig deeper into, but have to pass on to stay “focused”. I always felt that I was missing out on something by filtering in this way, so I started opening hundreds of tabs, bookmarking EVERYTHING, or trying to hold it in the back of my mind to Google later on. It was a mess, and barely effective.
